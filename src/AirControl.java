//On my honor:
//
//- I have not used source code obtained from another current or
//former student, or any other unauthorized source, either
//modified or unmodified.
//
//- All source code and documentation used in my program is either my
//original work, or was derived by me from the source code
//published in the textbook for this course. I understand that I am
//permitted to use an LLM tool to assist me with writing project
//code, under the condition that I submit with the project a text
//file that contains the full transcript of my interactions with
//the LLM (showing my prompts and the LLM's response). I understand
//that I am responsible for being able to complete this work
//without the use of LLM assistance.
//
//- I have not discussed coding details about this project with
//anyone other than my partner (in the case of a joint
//submission), instructor, ACM/UPE tutors or the TAs assigned
//to this course. I understand that I may discuss the concepts
//of this program with other students, and that another student
//may help me debug my program so long as neither of us writes
//anything during the discussion or modifies any computer file
//during the discussion. I have violated neither the spirit nor
//letter of this restriction.
